Digital Designer Project 1: Digital Circuit Realizer
By Ahmed A. Agiza and Mohammed R. Ananny

Project Description:
This projects aims at desiging a web tool to analyze logic circuit, adjust the layout and graph it.

Framework and libraries:
-Node.js web framework.
-Express.js web application framework.
-Joint.js graphing library.
-AlloyUI front-end framework.

Implementaion Plan:
-File processing (Complete).
-Netlist parsing (Complete).
-Establishing components objects and connections(Complete).
-Topological sorting and placement level analysis for each component(Under research).
-UI desing using AlloyUI.
-Circuit graphing using Joint.js(In-progress).
-Customizing netlist parsing using EDIF file (not guaranteed in the given timeframe, infrastructure ready).
